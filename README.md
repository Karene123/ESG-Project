# ESG-Project
Project for Regression (STAT 415-615)

Since 2019 The Word Bank publishes a Sovereign ESG Data Framework Environment, Social, and Governance. This framework is divided into 3 pillars (Environmental, Social and Governance) which is based on their 17 sustainable development goals. The purpose is to help potential investors and shed light on countriesâ€™ sustainability performance. As for their design study, they collect data from different sources but their main data source is  the World Bank.We are interested in studying the associations that exist between the variables across these themes; specifically, we are interested in looking at expected lifespan as the response variable in our multiple regression model. We specifically are interested in seeing how the variables impact life expectancy across groups of people, such as gender, development status, and income, regions of the world including Latin America, European Union, Central Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific, and over a time span of 5 years.

The variables we were interested in analyzing to study their association to life expectancy include: 
- (1)  CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)
- (2) prevalence of overweight (% of adults)
- (3) hospital beds (per 1000 people)
- (4) fertility rate (births per women)
- (5) government effectiveness (estimate)
- (6) portion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%)
- (7) political stability and absence of violence/terrorism (estimate)
- (8) GDP (annual growth %)
- (9) school enrollment primary and secondary and gender parity index (gross)
- (10) ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%)
- (11) voice and accountability (estimate)
- (12) population density (people per sq. km of land area)
- (13) fossil fuel (% of total)
- (14) Rule of Law
- (15) Internet Usage

We choose these variables to explore different interests across group members and to explore possible associations among different categories of indicators (i.e. the impact of climate change on life expectancy). The sample size is 1,081. 

We wished to examine different variables that are not traditionally associated with life expectancy or social determinants of health. 

As part of this project, the following statistical methods were utilized:
- Overall F-test
- Transformations involving the use of log
- Simple Linear Regression

We were able to provide a model including 5 variables out of the original 15.
